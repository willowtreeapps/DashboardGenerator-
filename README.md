# WTDashboardJSONGenerator

## Purpose 
The purpose of this tool is to help build and preview the layout of a WillowTree project dashboard. When the user is happy with the layout, they can have the JSON string generated for them which would be a great starting point for the current [Atlasboard dashboard generator](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/wt-atlasboards-generator).

## Goal 
The current goal for this app is:
1. Allow user to add, delete, reorder and resize items in a grid
2. Fetch the list of jobs and widgets and allow user to assign them to an item in the grid
3. Export the JSON in the correct format for the existing dashboard generator (see above link)

## Muuri
This project uses [Muuri](https://haltu.github.io/muuri/) for the drag and drop grid.
